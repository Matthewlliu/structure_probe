Introduction for the formal language KOPL is as followed.
KOPL is a query language for knowledge-based question answering. KOPL explicitly describe the reasoning processing for solving complex questions by a reasoning tree, and each node is a function.
The function library is as followed:
1. Findall(): Return all entities in KB.
2. Find(): Return all entities with the given name.
3. FilterConcept(): Find those belonging to the given concept.
4. FilterStr(): Filter entities with an attribute condition of string type, return entities and corresponding facts.
5. FilterNum(): Similar to FilterStr, but atrribute type is number.
6. FilterYear(): Similar to FilterStr, but attribute type is year.
7. FilterDate(): Similar to FilterStr, but attribute type is date.
8. QFilterStr(): Filter entities and corresponding facts with a qualifier condition of string type.
9. QFilterNum(): Similar to QFilterStr, but qualifier type is number.
10. QFilterYear(): Similar to QFilterStr, but qualifier type is year.
11. QFilterDate(): Similar to QFilterStr, but qualifier type is date.
12. Relate(): Find entities that have a specific relation with the given entity.
13. And(): Return the intersection of two entity sets.
14. Or(): Return the union of two entity sets.
15. QueryName(): Return the entity name.
16. Count(): Return the number of entities.
17. QueryAttr(): Return the attribute value of the entity.
18. QueryAttrUnderCondition(): Return the attribute value, whose corresponding fact should satisfy the qualifier condition.
19. QueryRelation(): Return the relation between two entities.
20. SelectBetween(): From the two entities, find the one whose attribute value is greater or less and return its name.
21. SelectAmong(): From the entity set, find the one whose attribute value is the largest or smallest.
22. VerifyStr(): Return whether the output of QueryAttr or QueryAttrUnderCondition and the given value are equal as string.
23. VerifyNum(): Return whether the two numbers satisfy the condition.
24. VerifyYear(): Similar to VerifyNum.
25. VerifyDate(): Similar to VerifyNum.
26. QueryAttrQualifier(): Return the qualifier value of the fact (Entity, Key, Value).
27. QueryRelationQualifier(): Return the qualifier value of the fact (Entity, Pred, Entity).
